### Assignment: vae
#### Date: Deadline: May 13, 23:59
#### Points: 3 points

In this assignment you will implement a simple Variational Autoencoder
for three datasets in the MNIST format.

Your goal is to modify the
[vae.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/past-1718/labs/10/vae.py)
template and implement a functional VAE using the embedded TODO notes.

After submitting the task to ReCodEx, you can experiment with the three
available datasets (`fashion`, `cifar-cars` and `mnist-data`) and different
latent variable dimensionality (`z_dim=2` and `z_dim=100`). The generated images
are available in TensorBoard logs.
